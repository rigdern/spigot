# Ideas
- Can we create a model where a feedback loop switches from balancing to reinforcing or vice versa?
- Directly drawing the graphs for time-dependent parameters

# TODO
- [x] Figure out what to do about time indexing
- [x] Change time indexing from absolute to relative
- [x] Consider updating the time implementation to match Stella. Every component gets a value on every frame. And every component can refer to the value its inputs have on that frame.
- [ ] Create specs for some other models (e.g. figure 42)
- [ ] Work on UI
